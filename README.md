# Bwi Example Project

_Basic marketing automation._

## Presentation

This project serves as a go-to example for implementing bwi in your code.

The code in this repository is used in the same way your code will be, allowing you to simply copy, paste and customize the example code below.

## Structure

The code contains a [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) in the top-level directory of the repository.
This file will be the one used ton install the dependencies of your project.
Your dependencies are _currently_ common to all the **bees** in your project.

In this example project, we have several **bees**:
- [`add_to_marketing_automation.py`](./add_to_marketing_automation.py)
- [`alert_signup.py`](./alert_signup.py)
- [`billing.py`](./billing.py)
- [`multiple_methods.py`](./multiple_methods.py)
- [`no_method.py`](./no_method.py)
- [`no_result.py`](./no_result.py)
- [`signup.py`](./signup.py)
- [`send_welcome_gift.py`](./send_welcome_gift.py)
